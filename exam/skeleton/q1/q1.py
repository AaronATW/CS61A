    A kv store is a store that associates keys with values.

    To create a kv store, call the function `kv`, to get a `put` function.
    This function enables you to "put" a key-value pair into the store, and
    returns two functions `get` and another `put`. The `get` function should
    let you look up a key and return its corresponding value, while the
    new `put` function should let you continue adding on to the existing
    kv store.

    Note that you can assume that every key provided is unique. If you try to
    get the value for a key that does not exist, return 0.

    For details, refer to the doctest.
